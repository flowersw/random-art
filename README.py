# Hey Clinton,
#
# I got this to work, but, it's nothing special. I had trouble putting random sequences of functions together.' \
# I did find the sympy library, and I think that maybe would have helped, but was not able to implement it.
# You should be able to see what I was going for in my code. What could I have done to make it work?
# Of the code that worked, an image I liked was seed 883. Thanks, and see ya tomorrow.
